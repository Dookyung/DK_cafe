```

## R for text

character strings:

```{r}
my_string <- "This is a nice little string! Isn't it?"
my_string2 <- 'This little string contains "apices". What is the word for them?'
my_string3 <- "Also this string contains a ' character."
```

they are a tad different:

```{r}
my_string4 <- `my_string`
my_string5 <- 'my_string'

my_string4
my_string5
```

Finally, we can have vectors of strings.

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("JoeyBernhardt/singer")
library(singer)
places <- unique(singer_locations$city)
```


### The tools of the trade

There are a bunch of libraries which makes life much easier. 

    * `stringr` and `glue` in the tidyverse world
    
    * `stringi` is the core of `stringr`. I don't use it often: `stringr` does everything I need.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(glue)
```

__Gluing is caring__

The function `glue()` allows to compose strings in a programmatic and elegant way. 

    * mere convenient than `paste()` or `paste0()`

    * `glue()` knows the environment in which you call it. 
    
```{r}
My_name <- "Giulio"
My_age <- 32
My_twitter <- "ipnosimmia"
glue('My name is {My_name},',
  ' my age next year is {My_age + 1},',
  ' my twitter handle is @{My_twitter}.')
```

    * It also preserves indentation and new lines (but you have to start from the beginning):

```{r}
glue('
My name is {My_name},
           my age last year was {My_age - 2},
   my twitter handle is @{My_twitter}.
')
```

    * If we don't want to create permament variables for those string, we can pass them *after* the string as on-the-fly parameters
_
```{r}
glue('Today is {_____} and the sun shines.',
     today_date = Sys.Date())
```

    * use a `format()`ting

```{r}
phrase <- 'Today is {today_date} and the sun shines.'
glue(_____,
     today_date = format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %d, %Y"))
```

`glue` also works with data frames, via the `glue_data()` function.

```{r}
singer_locations %>%
 filter(!is.na(city)) %>%
 glue_data("{_____} is from the city of {_____}.") %>%
  head()
```


### Stringr for the string practitioner

The package `stringr` provides a wide variety of string manipulation functions.

```{r}
getNamespaceExports("stringr")
```


There's a bunch of them starting with `str_`.
Let's take a look a `str_view()`:

```{r}
getNamespaceExports("stringr") %>%
  str_view("_____")
```

A similar function is `str_subset()`.

```{r}
getNamespaceExports("stringr") %>%
  str_subset("_____")
```

##### Challenge

Let's use `str_subset()` to identify all the bands' places containing the string `new`.

```{r}
places %>%
  str_subset("____")
```


## Character vectors: where they fit in

### Resources

#### Manipulating character vectors

- __stringr package__
  
    * A non-core package in the tidyverse. 
    * Main functions start with `str_`.
    * Replacements for base functions re: string manipulation and regular expressions (see below).
    * Greater consistency about inputs and outputs.
    
    
- __tidyr package__

    * Especially useful for functions that split 1 character vector into many and *vice versa*: `separate()`, `unite()`, `extract()`.
    * Base functions: `nchar()`, `strsplit()`, `substr()`, `paste()`, `paste0()`.
    
- __glue package__

    * fantastic for string interpolation. 
    * If `stringr::str_interp()` doesn't get your job done, check out glue.



## Load stringr and the core tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

### Regex-free string manipulation with stringr and tidyr

- __ Detect or filter on a target string__

    * Which fruits actually use the word "fruit"?

```{r}
str_detect(fruit, pattern = "fruit")
```

    * to get the actual fruits that match

```{r}
(my_fruit <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "fruit"))
```

- __String splitting by delimiter__

```{r}
str_split(my_fruit, pattern = " ")
```

    * to commit to the number of pieces, you can use `str_split_fixed()` and get a character matrix.

```{r}
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
```

    * to-be-split variable lives in a data frame, `tidyr::separate()` will split it into 2 or more variables.

```{r}
my_fruit_df <- tibble(my_fruit)
my_fruit_df %>% 
  separate(my_fruit, into = c("pre", "post"), sep = " ")
```

- __Substring extraction (and replacement) by position__

    * Count characters in your strings with `str_length()`. 
    
```{r}
length(my_fruit)
str_length(my_fruit)
```

    * snip out substrings based on character position with `str_sub()`.

```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_sub(1, 3)
```

    * The `start` and `end` arguments are vectorised. 
```{r}
tibble(fruit) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  mutate(snip = str_sub(fruit, 1:6, 3:8))
```

    * `str_sub()` also works for assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of `<-`.

```{r}
(x <- head(fruit, 3))
str_sub(x, 1, 3) <- "AAA"
x
```

- __Collapse a vector__

    * collapse a character vector of length `n > 1` to a single string with `str_c()`.

```{r}
head(fruit) %>% 
  str_c(collapse = ", ")
```

### Create a character vector by catenating multiple vectors

If you have two or more character vectors of the same length, you can glue them together element-wise, to get a new vector of that length. Here are some ... awful smoothie flavors?

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ")
```

Element-wise catenation can be combined with collapsing.

```{r}
str_c(fruit[1:4], fruit[5:8], sep = " & ", collapse = ", ")
```

If the to-be-combined vectors are variables in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::unite()` to make a single new variable from them

```{r}
fruit_df <- tibble(
  fruit1 = fruit[1:4],
  fruit2 = fruit[5:8]
)
fruit_df %>% 
  unite("flavor_combo", fruit1, fruit2, sep = " & ")
```

- __Substring replacement__

    * replace a pattern with `str_replace()`

```{r}
str_replace(my_fruit, pattern = "fruit", replacement = "THINGY")
```

    * replacing `NA`, for which there is `str_replace_na()`.

```{r}
melons <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
melons[2] <- NA
melons
str_replace_na(melons, "UNKNOWN MELON")
```

If the `NA`-afflicted variable lives in a data frame, you can use `tidyr::replace_na()`.

```{r}
tibble(melons) %>% 
  replace_na(replace = list(melons = "UNKNOWN MELON"))
```


## Regular expressions with stringr

![](img/regexbytrialanderror-big-smaller.png)

### Load Gapminder

`r nlevels(gapminder::gapminder$country)` unique country names to the object `countries`.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
countries <- levels(gapminder$country)
```

### Characters with special meaning

- The first metacharacter is the period `.`, which stands for any single character, except a newline (which by the way, is represented by `\n`). 
    
    * The regex `a.b` will match all countries that have an `a`, followed by any single character, followed by `b`. 
    
```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a")
```

- **Anchors**: The `^` indicates the beginning of string and `$` indicates the end.

    * Note how the regex `i.a$` matches many fewer countries than `i.a` alone. Likewise, more elements of `my_fruit` match `d` than `^d`, which requires "d" at string start.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, pattern = "i.a$")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "d")
str_subset(my_fruit, pattern = "^d")
```

- The metacharacter `\b` indicates a **word boundary** and `\B` indicates NOT a word boundary. 


```{r}
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "melon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\bmelon")
str_subset(fruit, pattern = "\\Bmelon")
```

### Character classes

- Character classes are usually given inside square brackets, `[]` but a few come up so often that we have a metacharacter for them, such as `\d` for a single digit.

```{r}
## make a class "by hand"
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[nls]ia$")
## use ^ to negate the class
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[^nls]ia$")
```

- to match whitespace: the `\s` metacharacter and the POSIX class `[:space:]`. 

    * Notice that we must prepend an extra backslash `\` to escape `\s` and the POSIX class has to be surrounded by two sets of square brackets.

```{r}
## remember this?
# str_split_fixed(fruit, pattern = " ", n = 2)
## alternatives
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "\\s", n = 2)
str_split_fixed(my_fruit, pattern = "[[:space:]]", n = 2)
```

- see the country names that contain punctuation.

```{r}
str_subset(countries, "[[:punct:]]")
```

### Quantifiers


| quantifier | meaning   | quantifier | meaning                    |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------|
| *          | 0 or more | {n}        | exactly n                  |
| +          | 1 or more | {n,}       | at least n                 |
| ?          | 0 or 1    | {,m}       | at most m                  |
|            |           | {n,m}      | between n and m, inclusive |


```{r}
(matches <- str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.*e"))
```


```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.+e")))
```


```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "l.?e")))
```


```{r}
list(match = intersect(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")),
     no_match = setdiff(matches, str_subset(fruit, pattern = "le")))
```

### Escaping

characters with special meaning in regexes, including `$ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \`.

TO *escape* it by prepending a backslash. 
you need to preprend two backslashes in order to match a literal plus sign in a regex.

#### Escapes in plain old strings

- To escape quotes inside quotes:

    ```{r}
    cat("Do you use \"airquotes\" much?")
    ```

- To insert newline (`\n`) or tab (`\t`):
    ```{r}
    cat("before the newline\nafter the newline")
    cat("before the tab\tafter the tab")
    ```

#### Escapes in regular expressions

```{r}
## cheating using a POSIX class ;)
str_subset(countries, pattern = "[[:punct:]]")
## using two backslashes to escape the period
str_subset(countries, pattern = "\\.")
```

A last example that matches an actual square bracket.

```{r}
(x <- c("whatever", "X is distributed U[0,1]"))
str_subset(x, pattern = "\\[")
```
